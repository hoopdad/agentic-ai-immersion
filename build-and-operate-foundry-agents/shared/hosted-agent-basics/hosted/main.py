"""Labs 3-4: the Healthcare Marketplace concierge as a Microsoft Foundry Hosted Agent (Responses protocol).

Goal:    the smallest complete hosted agent: Agent Framework `Agent` + `FoundryChatClient` + three `@tool`
         functions over the systems of record (common.marketplace_data) + the shared compliance block, served by
         `ResponsesHostServer`. Foundry builds a container from this folder, runs it, scales it and gives it
         an identity; locally the same file is a process on port 8088.
Inputs:  env FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT (injected when hosted; from .env locally), AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME
         (or FOUNDRY_MODEL), optional MARKETPLACE_HOSTED_PORT. common/ and data/ are vendored here by prepare.py.
Outputs: HTTP server speaking the OpenAI Responses protocol (POST /responses) on port 8088.
Time:    10 min to read; the lab driver (../lab2_hosted_basics.py) starts and stops it for you.

Run:     python prepare.py && python main.py          (foreground; then python test_local.py in another terminal)
         python ../lab2_hosted_basics.py               (vendors, starts this server, runs S1 and S2, stops it)
Deploy:  python ../lab2_hosted_basics.py --deploy      (prints the azd commands; see ../README.md)

Verified shape (BRIEF-shared 5d, base repo hosted-agents/benefits-advisor-responses/main.py):
    client = FoundryChatClient(project_endpoint=ENDPOINT, model=MODEL, credential=DefaultAzureCredential())
    agent = Agent(client=client, instructions=INSTRUCTIONS, tools=tools, default_options={"store": False})
    ResponsesHostServer(agent).run()              # POST /responses, port 8088 locally

This product deliberately has no external history or workflow tool. Labs 5-6 extend the accepted sponsor
tool and enrollment policy into the knowledge concierge. Labs 7-8 branch into the primary hosted MAF triage
service. Optional Lab 12 delegates to that service; optional Lab 11 is a terminal Prompt Agent comparison.

# %% Instructions: the concierge role + the shared compliance block (verbatim, every agent)
ROLE_INSTRUCTIONS = """You are the Healthcare Marketplace concierge, the front door of the Individual Marketplace, running as a hosted agent.
You serve participants of both lines of business: the Marketplace (plan education, comparisons, enrollment
windows) and Accounts (HRA balance, claims, debit cards, premium reimbursement).

How to work:
1. Confirm identity with participant_id and ZIP code only, then use the tools for every fact about the
   participant, the enrollment window or the reimbursement account. Never guess. If a tool returns an error
   object, explain it plainly.
2. In this version you have no plan search and no knowledge base. When a participant asks to compare plans
   or for a rule you cannot look up, say so and offer a licensed benefit advisor.
3. When a participant asks which plan to pick, asks to enroll, or describes a situation that needs judgment,
   offer a licensed benefit advisor and summarise the case in two sentences for the handoff.
4. Short paragraphs, plain language.
