# Stretch 5: Prompt agents and a declarative workflow, called from the hosted agent

| | |
|---|---|
| Goal | Build the platform-managed side of the story: `healthcare-marketplace-concierge` and four specialist prompt agents with FunctionTools and the knowledge MCP tool, the YAML triage workflow agent (preview), run S1 through it, then give the hosted agent a `run_triage_workflow` tool that delegates to it. |
| Time | 60 min: teach 10, demo 10, do 35, checkpoint 5 (stretch: fast finishers or follow-up) |
| Starts from | artifacts/lab2/knowledge.json (or `python catch_up.py --through 2`) |
| Produces | artifacts/stretch5/agents.json, artifacts/stretch5/workflow.yaml, artifacts/stretch5/handoff_packets/S1.json |
| Learn path modules | 1 Develop AI agents with Microsoft Foundry and Visual Studio Code; 2 Integrate custom tools into your agent; 6 Build agent-driven workflows using Microsoft Foundry |

**Where this runs:** workstation notebook (`stretch5_walkthrough.ipynb` / `stretch5_prompt_agents.py`) creates and calls agents that run inside the Foundry project. No container here. `hosted_tool_snippet.py` is code for the Lab 2 container.

## Setup and run contract

Use the dev container's preinstalled Python 3.14 interpreter. From a fresh dev-container Bash terminal at the workshop root:

```bash
# Reopen the repository in its dev container; dependencies are preinstalled.
python --version  # Python 3.14
# Dependencies were installed by the repository dev-container bootstrap.
cd ./labs/stretch5-prompt-agents-and-workflows
python -m jupyter lab ./stretch5_walkthrough.ipynb
```

Select `python` as the VS Code notebook kernel. The notebook must start with this lab folder as its working directory. To run the equivalent driver from a separate terminal:

```bash
cd ./labs
python ./stretch5-prompt-agents-and-workflows/stretch5_prompt_agents.py
```

The driver exits nonzero and does not save `handoff_packets/S1.json` when the workflow reports an error, the S1 action path is not `triage -> marketplace -> compliance -> handoff`, the accounts branch runs, or the packet violates its exact field, stable-value, type, PII, recommendation, or timestamp contract.

## What you'll learn
- Create versioned prompt agents server-side with `PromptAgentDefinition`, `FunctionTool` schemas from `marketplace_data.TOOL_SCHEMAS`, and the knowledge base as an `MCPTool` through the project connection.
- Run the client-side function-call loop once and explain why a workflow cannot run client tools (facts are pre-fetched into the case).
- Deploy a declarative multi-agent workflow (`WorkflowAgentDefinition`, YAML, preview) and read its `workflow_action` stream.
- Decide, per agent, when a platform-managed prompt agent fits (business-owned instructions, portal governance, no deployment) and when hosted code fits (custom Python, session state, your own dependencies).
- Connect the two: one `@tool` on the hosted agent that calls the workflow agent with `agent_reference`.

## Technical features taught

| Feature | Foundry / SDK object | Where in the code | Why it matters for Healthcare Marketplace |
|---|---|---|---|
| Versioned prompt agents | `project.agents.create_version`, `PromptAgentDefinition(model, instructions, tools)` | `stretch5_prompt_agents.py` build() | Instruction changes are versions: auditable, revertible in the portal, no container roll |
| Function tools from shared schemas | `FunctionTool(name, description, parameters, strict)` via `lab_helpers.function_tools` | `SPECS`, build() | One schema source for platform agents and the hosted @tool functions |
| Knowledge over MCP on a platform agent | `MCPTool(server_label, server_url, require_approval="never", project_connection_id)` | knowledge_tool() | Same governed knowledge base as the hosted agent, reached through the project connection |
| Client-side function-call loop | `responses.create` + `FunctionCallOutput` (in `lab_helpers.run_turn`) | demo(--concierge-turn) | Shows who runs the Python: the client, not the platform |
| Declarative workflow agent (preview) | `WorkflowAgentDefinition(workflow=yaml)`, `InvokeAzureAgent`, `ConditionGroup` | `marketplace_triage_workflow.yaml`, render_workflow(), build() | Triage -> specialists -> compliance -> packet as a governed graph the portal draws |
| Streaming workflow actions | `responses.create(stream=True)` -> `workflow_action` items | run_case() | The action trail is the audit log of who touched the case |
| Hosted agent delegating to the platform | `@tool run_triage_workflow` -> `responses.create(..., extra_body=agent_reference)` | `hosted_tool_snippet.py` | Code agent owns the conversation; platform workflow owns the regulated hand-off |

## Teach (10 min)
- Two kinds of agents in one project. A **prompt agent** is data: model, instructions, tools; Foundry runs it, versions it, shows it in the portal. A **hosted agent** is code: your container, your dependencies, your session store. Both are invoked the same way (`agent_reference`), both are eval targets, both show traces.
- When a prompt agent fits: the behaviour is owned by the business (compliance reviewer wording, handoff packet fields), changes must be auditable without a deployment, and the tools are server-side (knowledge base over MCP) or simple. When hosted fits: custom Python around the model (session store, redaction middleware, in-process workflows), libraries the platform does not ship, or protocols like Invocations (Stretch 6).
- Workflows on the platform cannot answer a client-side `function_call`: nobody is there to run your Python. So the caller pre-fetches the facts from systems of record into a `TRIAGE CASE` header and the specialists work from that plus the knowledge base. The hosted agent is the natural caller: it already has the tools and the session.
- The YAML: `OnConversationStart`, `InvokeAzureAgent` per step, `ConditionGroup` on the triage route, `EndConversation`. Every `InvokeAzureAgent` names an agent that already exists; the workflow is one more versioned agent.
- Governance argument for the organization: compliance-reviewer and advisor-handoff instructions are regulated text. Keep them where compliance can read and change them (portal), not in a container image.
- Preview means: keep the YAML small, verify the Power Fx helpers against the docs before the day.

```

## Demo (10 min)
1. `python stretch5_prompt_agents.py --concierge-turn`. Point at six `created prompt agent ... vN` lines and `created workflow agent healthcare-marketplace-triage-workflow`.
2. The concierge turn: `tool get_participant(...)`, `tool get_enrollment_window(...)` printed by the client loop, then the answer. Say: "the platform asked us to run Python; a workflow cannot do that."
3. S1: `workflow_action` lines in order (triage, marketplace, compliance, handoff), messages, `saved artifacts/stretch5/handoff_packets/S1.json (lob=marketplace, flags=0)`. Any workflow, ordering, packet, or safety failure exits nonzero.
4. Portal: Agents > healthcare-marketplace-triage-workflow shows the graph; open the conversation to see the actions. Agents > compliance-reviewer > edit instructions in the portal: a new version, no deployment.
5. Open `hosted_tool_snippet.py`: one function, one Responses call, `agent_reference`. That is the whole integration.

## Do (35 min)
1. `python stretch5_prompt_agents.py --build-only`. Checkpoint: `saved artifacts/stretch5/agents.json` with six agents and the workflow version.
2. `python stretch5_prompt_agents.py --demo-only --concierge-turn`. Checkpoint: the concierge answer names the AEP dates and `no_recommendation=OK`; S1 produces `handoff_packets/S1.json` with `lob=marketplace` and `problems=none`.
3. Open `S1.json`: check `options_discussed` has no preference, `facts_gathered` sources are tool names or KB ids, `recommended_next_step_for_advisor` is a process step.
4. YOUR TURN (5 min): change an instruction in the portal (healthcare-marketplace-concierge: "Always greet the participant by first name"), then run the acceptance cell immediately below that heading. It calls the latest version, asserts the Evelyn greeting and safety checks, deletes the conversation, and restores the canonical concierge instructions in `finally`.
5. YOUR TURN (5 min): run the broken-router acceptance cell. It creates a temporary `ROUTE: accounts` triage version, proves the wrong branch ran and left marketplace questions open, deletes the conversation, and restores the canonical triage instructions in `finally`.
6. YOUR TURN (10 min): wire the hosted agent. Paste the block from `hosted_tool_snippet.py` into Lab 2 `hosted/main.py`, append the tool to `FUNCTION_TOOLS`, add the instruction line, and set `MARKETPLACE_WORKFLOW_AGENT_NAME=healthcare-marketplace-triage-workflow` in the server environment. Do not create a separate hosted package for this stretch. Run the hosted-delegation acceptance cell before redeploying Lab 2; it verifies the function and tool registration in Lab 2 source, requires `status=completed`, validates the packet, and the tool deletes its temporary conversation in `finally`. After redeployment, ask as P-1005 "Which ACA plan should I pick?" then accept the advisor.
7. Optional (5 min): `python hosted_tool_snippet.py --call` runs the tool from the workstation against the workflow, no container needed.

## Checkpoint (5 min)
Paste the `workflow_action` trail for S1 and the `lob=` line. `artifacts/stretch5/agents.json` must exist for the hosted tool to find the workflow name.

## Offline validation

No Azure access is required for the focused tests:

```bash
cd ./labs/stretch5-prompt-agents-and-workflows
python -m unittest ./test_stretch5_offline.py
```

The suite covers rendered workflow structure, packet extraction and validation, workflow-reference loading, explicit unavailable hosted behavior, and mocked workflow-action ordering.

## If you're behind
`python catch_up.py --through 5` builds the agents and the workflow (no S1 run). Skip steps 5 and 7; do step 6.

## Stretch (only if you're done early)
Add a revise loop to the YAML: a `ConditionGroup` after `compliance` that, when the review says `verdict: revise`, replaces the drafts with `revised_reply` before `handoff`. Rebuild, rerun S1 with a specialist instruction that violates rule 1 on purpose.

## Troubleshooting
| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `create_version` 401/403 | user lacks Azure AI User on the project, or wrong tenant | role assignment (5 to 15 min); `az login --tenant $TENANT_ID` |
| `knowledge.json has no mcp_endpoint or connection` | Lab 2 ran with `--skip-connection` | rerun Lab 2 without it, or `python catch_up.py --through 2` |
| Workflow create fails on YAML | Power Fx helper or field name changed in the preview | compare with the base repo workflow sample; VERIFY link in the YAML header |
| `unanswered function_call` in errors | a specialist called a client tool inside the workflow | facts missing from the case header: extend gather_facts(); or remove the tool from the specialist |
| Packet has `problems` | model returned prose or an extra field | rerun; tighten the HANDOFF instructions; the strict schema is enforced by validate_packet() |
| Hosted tool returns `not available` | `agents.json` not vendored and `MARKETPLACE_WORKFLOW_AGENT_NAME` unset | set the env var on the server or copy `agents.json` next to `main.py` |
| Hosted tool returns `status: failed` | workflow invocation, packet validation, or conversation cleanup failed | inspect `error`, `packet_problems`, and `cleanup_error`; do not present the result as a successful handoff |
| Model or region errors | deployment not in the project region | match `AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME` to the portal |
